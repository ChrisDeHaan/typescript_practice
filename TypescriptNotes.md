- What is Typescript?
    - A programming language created by Microsoft to help with the shortcomings of basic Javascript.
    - It is a Javascript language, so all JS files will work as TS files, but not vice versa.
    - TS is statically-typed, unlike JS
        - statically-typed means that we can declare a variable to be an integer, but can't later change it to a non-integer value. (ex: int number = 10 -> number = 'a' would not work in a statically typed language)
    - to make it very basic... Typescript is Javascript with Type Checking
- Drawbacks?
    - there is always a compilation step involved. This process is called transpilation.
        - run `tsc <filename>` in the terminal to compile your code
    - you have to be more disciplined when writing your code, as it is static and not dynamic.
- To make it simple
    - Typescript is great on medium to large projects as it can effectively catch common bugs and errors that you would normally need to check for in a dynamically typed language like JS.
- To create a congifuration file
    - run `tsc --init`
    - common options:
        - target - the version of JS you want to target (es2016 is default)
        - module - 
        - rootDir - default to './' but can be changed to a different head depending on your project
        - outDir - default to './' and is the location transpiled code will be placed
        - removeComments - removes all comments in TS code, which makes JS transpiled code shorter
        - noEmitOnError - if you have any mistakes in your code, it will not generate a JS file
        - sourceMap - a file that specifices how each line of our TS code maps to our generated JS code
        - noImplicityAny - compiler will no longer infer 'any' for variables without a declared value
- Once you have a sourceMap, you can put stops in the code, select "Run and Debug" in left menu, select "create a launch.json file", and select node.js. This will create a launch.json file
    - Add an additional code under "program" `"preLaunchTask": "tsc: build - tsconfig.json"`
    - What we're telling it to do with that code is to use the typescript compiler to build our application using the tsconfig.json file.
        - if you get error, a workaround is to instead use this code `"preLaunchTask": "npm: debug",` and add `  "scripts": {"debug": "tsc --sourcemap"}` under package.json
- Typescript adds additional built-in functions:
    - any - variable type that essentially turns the variable into a dynamic typed one (avoid when possible)
    - unknown
    - never
    - enum
    - tuple
